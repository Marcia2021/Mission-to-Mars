# Mission to Mars Analysis

## Overview of Mission to Mars

Web scraping is very useful to automates tasks for projects to extract online data from variety data sources. In this Module, we were able to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate web browser and perform web scrape, stored the data in a MongoDB database, finally created an HTML/CSS portfolio and used Bootstrap components to polish and customize. 

Besides all the information we get so far, we are going to help Robin to get additional four images of Marâ€™s hemispheres online and add them to the portfolio.


## Analysis

We got all the data/images online from variety of data sources, including Mars News (News - Mars Exploration Program (redplanetscience.com)), Mars Featured Images (Space Image (spaceimages-mars.com)), Mars Facts (Mars Facts - Interesting facts about Planet Mars (data-class-mars-facts.s3.amazonaws.com)) and Mars Hemispheres (Astropedia Search Results | GUSS Astrogeology Science Center (marshemispheres.com)). 

We drafted the script in Jupyter Notebook. Used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to conduct web scraping, stored the data in MongoDB database, used Flask to build the app.
